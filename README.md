# TurboCraft

The TurboCraft modpack is designed to deliver top-notch performance by integrating the best optimization mods available, meticulously configured for peak efficiency. Through extensive research and testing, TurboCraft often surpasses other optimization solutions in performance benchmarks. When it doesn't, I dive into the details to enhance it further.

TurboCraft prioritizes maintainability and simplicity. This means it includes minimal quality-of-life or visual improvements by default, allowing you to add any non-optimization mods as needed. If you encounter any issues or have feedback, feel free to join our Discord server where we're happy to assist and listen to your suggestions.

With TurboCraft, you can expect rapid mod updates, bringing you the latest performance enhancements and the ability to quickly adapt to new Minecraft versions, often within hours or minutes. I aim to keep the modpack as up-to-date and relevant as possible.
